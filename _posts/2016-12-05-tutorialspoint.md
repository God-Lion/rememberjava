Over at [Tutorialspoint.com][tp] they have created a superb well of study material and tools. Most impressive are the online [compiler and runtime terminals, dubbed Coding Ground][tp-terms], for a large selection of popular and obscure languages and tools. [Here's an example Java project][tp-demo], based on the [previous article on word counting][rj-word-count]. Click *Compile* followed by *Execute* and the output from the snippet will show in the terminal. The data file "words" is included in the project. (Note that these terminal seems to run best in Chrome based browsers, and fails to load in Firefox).

Also worth checking out is their [long list of tutorials][tp-tut] for everything from Java; other programming languages; to sports and "soft skills". Especially with the programming tutorials, their embedded online compiler & terminal feels very slick, as seen below.

My personal site fades in comparison, however, my goal is not to offer complete university courses. Remember Java will remain focused on exploration and examples of interesting aspects of the Java language.
