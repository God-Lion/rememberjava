I'm rebooting this site, in the form of a blog with Java snippets and experiments. There have been lots of enhancements in the Java language and APIs over the years, and I'd like to use this blog to explore some of time. I expect the typical article form to be more single topic investigation with a few examples, as opposed to the old tutorial style.

To make it easier to maintain the site, I've switched to a [Jekyll][jekyll] / [Markdown][markdown] based static site generation, [hosted on GitHub][gh-pages]. The source for the site and all code can be found at [github.com/hblok/rememberjava][rj-gh] .

For what it's worth, [the old site][rj-old], including full Java code examples, can be [found on the Internet Archive][rj-old].
